## INTRODUCTION   
Because the traditional tabular methods are not applicable in arbitrarily large state spaces, we turn to those approximate solution methods (`linear approximator & nonlinear approximator` `value-function approximation & policy approximation`), which is to find a good approximate solution using limited computational resources.  We can use a `linear function`, or `multi-layer artificial neural networks`, or `decision tree` as a parameterized function to approximate the value-function or policy.(More, read Sutton's book [Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction](http://incompleteideas.net/book/the-book-2nd.html) Chapter 9).  

The following methods are all `value-function approximation` and `gradient-based(using the gradients to update the parameters)`, and they all use **experience replay** and **target network** to eliminate the correlations present in the sequence of observations.  

## 1>Linear 
Using a linear function to approximate the value function(always the action value).  
$
\hat v(s, w) \doteq w^Tx(s) \doteq \sum \limits_{i=1}^d w_i x_i
$
$w$ is the parameters, $x(s)$ is called a <u>*feature vector*</u> representing state $s$, and the state $s$ is the images(frames) observed by the agent in most time. So a linear approximator implemented with *tensorflow* can be just a fully-connected layer.  
``` python
import tensorflow as tf
# state: a sequence of image(frame)
inputs = tf.layers.flatten(state)
# scope, which is used to distinguish q_params and target_q_params
out = layers.fully_connected(inputs, num_actions, scope=scope, reuse=reuse)
```

## 2>Nonlinear-DQN
***Deep Q-Network.*** The main difference of *DQN* from *linear approximator* is the architecture of getting the *q_value*, it is nonlinear.

And the total algorithm is as follows:

The approximator of DeepMind DQN implemented with *tensorflow* as described in their [Nature paper](https://www.nature.com/articles/nature14236) can be:
``` python
import tensorflow as tf
with tf.variable_scope(scope, reuse=reuse) as _:
	conv1 = layers.conv2d(state, num_outputs=32, kernel_size=(8, 8), stride=4, activation_fn=tf.nn.relu)
	conv2 = layers.conv2d(conv1, num_outputs=64, kernel_size=(4, 4), stride=2, activation_fn=tf.nn.relu)
	conv3 = layers.conv2d(conv2, num_outputs=64, kernel_size=(3, 3), stride=1, activation_fn=tf.nn.relu)
	full_inputs = layers.flatten(conv3)
	full_layer = layers.fully_connected(full_inputs, num_outputs=512, activation_fn=tf.nn.relu)
	out = layers.fully_connected(full_layer, num_outputs=num_actions)
```

## 3>Nonlinear-DDQN
***Double DQN.*** The main difference of *DDQN* from *DQN* is the way of calculating the target q value.
As a reminder,   
In <u>Q-Learning:</u>  
$$
Q(s,a) \leftarrow Q(s,a) + \alpha[r + \lambda max_{a'}Q(s',a') − Q(s,a)]
$$  
$$
Y_t^{Q} = R_{t+1} + \lambda max_{a'}Q(S_{t+1},a') = R_{t+1} + \lambda Q(S_{t+1},argmax_{a'}Q(S_{t+1},a'))
$$  
In <u>DQN:</u>  

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huixxi/TensorFlow2.0-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/master/images/ddqn.png)

where $\theta_{i-1}$ is the target network parameters which is always represeted with $\theta_t^-$.  
$$
Y_t^{DQN} = R_{t+1} + \lambda max_{a'}Q(S_{t+1},a';\theta_t^-)
$$  
There is a problem with deep q-learning that "It is known to sometimes learn unrealistically high action values because it includes a maximization step over estimated action values, which tends to prefer overestimated to underestimated values" as said in [DDQN paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.06461.pdf).  
The idea of <u>Double Q-learning</u> is to reduce overestimations by decomposing the max operation in the target into action selection and action evaluation.  
$$
Y_t^{DoubleQ} = R_{t+1} + \lambda Q(S_{t+1}, argmax_{a'}Q(S_{t+1},a';\theta_t);\theta_t^-)
$$  
Implement with *tensorflow* (the minimal possible change to DQN in cs234 assignment 2)  
``` python
# DQN
q_samp = tf.where(self.done_mask, self.r, self.r + self.config.gamma * tf.reduce_max(target_q, axis=1))
actions = tf.one_hot(self.a, num_actions)
q = tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(q, actions), axis=1)
self.loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.squared_difference(q_samp, q))

# DDQN
max_q_idxes = tf.argmax(q, axis=1)
max_actions = tf.one_hot(max_q_idxes, num_actions)
q_samp = tf.where(self.done_mask, self.r, self.r + self.config.gamma * tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(target_q, max_actions), axis=1))
actions = tf.one_hot(self.a, num_actions)
q = tf.reduce_sum(tf.multiply(q, actions), axis=1)
self.loss = tf.reduce_mean(tf.squared_difference(q_samp, q))
```

## 4>Prioritized experience replay 
***Prioritized experience replay.*** Improve data efficiency, by replaying more often transitions from which there is more to learn.  
***And the total algorithm is as follows:***    

![Paper: Prioritized Experience Replay](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huixxi/CS234-Reinforcement-Learning/master/rl_images/prior_replay.png)

* Prioritizing with Temporal-Difference(TD) Error   
TD-Error: how far the value is from its next-step bootstrap estimate $$ r + \lambda V(s') - V(s) $$    
Where the value $r + \lambda V(s') $ is known as the TD target.    
Experiences with high magnitude TD error also appear to be replayed more often. TD-errors have also been used as a prioritization mechanism for determining where to focus resources, for example when choosing where to explore or which features to select. However, the TD-error can be a poor estimate in some circumstances as well, e.g. when rewards are noisy.

* Stochastic Prioritization  
Because `greedy prioritization` results in high-error transitions are replayed too frequently causing lack of diversity which could lead to `over-fitting`. So `Stochastic Prioritization` is intruduced in order to add diversity and find a balance between greedy prioritization and random sampling.  
We ensure that the probability of being sampled is monotonic in a transition’s priority, while guaranteeing a non-zero probability even for the lowest-priority transition. Concretely, the probability of sampling transition i as  
$$
P(i) = \frac{p_i^{\alpha}}{\sum_kp_k^{\alpha}}
$$  
(Note: the probability of sampling transition $P(i)$ has nothing to do with the probability to sample a transition(experience) in the replay buffer(sum tree), which is based on the transition's priority $p_i$. So don't be confused by it, the $P(i)$ is used to calculate the `Importance Sampling(IS) Weight`.)  
where $p_i > 0$ is the priority of transition $i$. The exponent α determines how much prioritization is used, with $\alpha = 0$ corresponding to the uniform case.
  * proportional prioritization: $p_i = |\delta_i| + \epsilon$   
  * rank-based prioritization: $p_i = \frac{1}{rank(i)}$ , where $rank(i)$ is the rank of transition $i$ sorted according to $\delta_i$.  

* Importance Sampling(IS)  
Because prioritized replay introduces a bias that changes this distribution uncontrollably. This can be corrected by using importance-sampling (IS) weights:  
$$
w_i = (\frac{1}{N} \frac{1}{P(i)})^\beta
$$  
that fully compensate for the non-uniform probabilities $P(i)$  if $\beta = 1$. These weights can be folded into the Q-learning update by using $w_i\delta_i$ instead of $\delta_i$. For stability reasons, we always normalize weights by $1 / max_i w_i$ so that they only scale the update downwards.  
`IS` is annealed from $\beta_0$ to $1$, which means its affect is felt more strongly at the end of the stochastic process; this is because the unbiased nature of the updates in RL is most important near convergence.

## 5>Dueling network architecture   
***Dueling network architecture.*** Generalize across actions by separately representing state values and action advantages. 
The dueling network is a neural network architecture designed for value based RL which has a $|A|$ dimension output that Q-value for each action. It features two streams of computation, the **state value** and **action advantage** streams, sharing a convolutional encoder, and merged by a special aggregator layer.   

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huixxi/TensorFlow2.0-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/master/images/dueling_netarch.png)

The aggregator can be expressed as:  
$$
Q(s, a; \theta, \alpha, \beta) = V(s; \theta, \beta) + \big(A(s, a; \theta, \alpha) - \frac{1}{|A|} \sum_{a'}A(s, a'; \theta, \alpha)\big)
$$
where $\theta, \beta, \alpha$, respectively, the parameters of the shared convolutional encoder, value stream, and action advantage stream.  
**The details of dueling network architecture for Atari:**  
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huixxi/TensorFlow2.0-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/master/images/dueling_detail.png)  

Since both the value and the advantage stream propagate gradients to the last convolutional layer in the backward pass, we rescale the combined gradient entering the last convolutional layer by $1/\sqrt{2}$. This simple heuristic mildly increases stability. In addition, we clip the gradients to have their norm less than or equal to $10$.   
  
**Other tricks:**  

* ***Human Starts:*** Using 100 starting points sampled from a human expert’s trajectory.
* ***Saliency maps:*** To better understand the roles of the value and the advantage streams.

## 6>Multi-step bootstrapping  
***Multi-step bootstrap targets.*** Shift the bias-variance tradeoff and helps to propagate newly observed rewards faster to earlier visited states.  
The best methods are often intermediate between the two extremes. *n-step TD learning method*  lies between **Monte Carlo** and **one-step TD methods**.  

* Monte Carlo methods perform an update for each state based on the entire sequence of observed rewards from that state until the end of the episode  
$$
G_t \doteq R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \gamma^2R_{t+3} + \dots + \gamma^{T−t−1}R_T
$$

* The update of one-step TD methods(also called TD(0) methods), on the other hand, is based on just the one next reward, bootstrapping from the value of the state one step later as a proxy for the remaining rewards.  
$$
G_{t:t+1} \doteq R_{t+1} + \gamma V_t(S_{t+1})
$$

* Now, n-step TD methods perform a tradeoff that update each state after **n** time steps, based on **n** next rewards, bootstrapping from the value of the state **n** step later as a proxy for the remaining rewards.  
$$
G_{t:t+n} \doteq R_{t+1} + \gamma R_{t+2} + \dots + \gamma ^{n−1}R_{t+n} + \gamma^n V_{t+n−1}(S_{t+n})
$$


We know that Q-learning is a kind of TD learning. All the implementations before are based on TD(0) learing updating. Now, we are going to implement a n-step deep Q-learning method, the most different part is how to calculate the *target* Q value. 
In one-step DQN:  
$$
q_{target} = R_{t+1} + \gamma_{t+1} \max q_{\bar{\theta}}(S_{t+1}, a') 
$$

In one-step Double DQN, the loss is :  
$$
q_{target} = R_{t+1} + \gamma_{t+1} q_{\bar{\theta}}(S_{t+1}, \arg\max_{a'} q_{\theta}(S_{t+1}, a'))
$$

In multi-step Double DQN, the loss is :  
$$
R^{(n)}\_t = \sum\limits_{k=0}^{n-1} \gamma_t^{(k)}R_{t+k+1} 
$$  

$$
q_{target} = R^{(n)}\_t + \gamma_{t}^n q_{\bar{\theta}}(S_{t+n}, \arg\max_{a'} q_{\theta}(S_{t+n}, a'))
$$  

(The algorithm looks easy to implement and stability guaranteed, but it brings much fluctuation and seems learning rate sensitive when used to train the agent to play CartPole-v0. So if you check this model, you maybe should pay a little bit more attention to it.)

## 7>Distributional Q-learning  
***Distributional Q-learning.*** Learn a categorical distribution of discounted returns, instead of its expectation.  
In Q learning:  
$$
Q(s, a) = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{n} p_{r_i}r_i(s, a) + \gamma \sum\limits_{s' \in S} P(s'|s, a)\max_{a' \in A(s')}Q(s', a') 
$$
$$
Q(s, a) = E_{s, a}[ r(s, a) ] + \gamma E_{s, a, s'}[ \max_{a' \in A(s')}Q(s', a') ]  \\
$$
$$
Q(s, a) = E_{s, a, s'}[ r(s, a)  + \gamma  \max_{a' \in A(s')}Q(s', a') ]
$$
Where $Q(s, a)$ is the expection of the discounted returns.  
Now, in distributional rl, instead of calculating  the expection, we work directly with the full distribution of the returns of state $s$, action $a$ and following the current policy $\pi$, denoted by a random variable $Z(s, a)$.   

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huixxi/TensorFlow2.0-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/master/images/distributional_rl.png)

Where $z_i - z_{i-1} = \Delta z = (V_{min} - V_{max}) / N$, we assume that the range of the return $z_i$ is from $V_{min}$ to $V_{max}$, $N$ is the number of atoms, $(z_i, p_i(s, a))$. Now, for each state-action pair $(s, a)$, there is a corresponding distribution of its returns, not a expection value. We calculate the action value of $(s, a)$ as $Q(s, a) = E[Z(s, a)]$. Even through we still use the expected value, what we're going to optimize is the distribution:  
$$
\sup_{s, a} dist(R(s, a) + \gamma Z_{\bar{\theta}}(s', a^\*), Z_{\theta}(s, a)) \\
a^* = \arg\max_{a′}Q(s′, a′) = \arg\max_{a′}E[Z(s′, a′)]
$$
The difference is obverse that, we still use a deep neural network to do function approximation, in traditional DQN, our output for each input state $s$ is a $|A|$-dim vector, each element corresponds to an action value $q(s, a)$, but now, the output for each input state $s$ is a $|A|N$-dim matrix, that each row is a $N$-dim vector represents the return distribution of $Z(s, a)$, then we calculate the action-value of $(s, a)$ through:   
$$
q(s, a) = E[Z(s, a)] = \sum\limits_{i=0}^{N} p_i(s, a) z_i
$$  
***KL Divergence***  
Now, we need to minimize the distance between the current distribution and the target distribution.   
***Note:*** the following content are mainly from that great blog: https://mtomassoli.github.io/2017/12/08/distributional_rl/#kl-divergence  
If $p$ and $q$ are two distributions with same support (i.e. their $pdfs$ are non-zero at the same points), then their KL divergence is defined as follows:  
$$
KL(p||q) = \int p(x) \log \frac{p(x)}{q(x)}dx \\
KL(p||q) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i) \log\frac{p(x_i)}{q(x_i)} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} p(x_i)[ \log{p(x_i)} - \log{q(x_i)}]
$$
"Now say we’re using DQN and extract $(s, a, r, s′)$ from the replay buffer. A “sample of the target distribution” is $r + \gamma Z_{\bar{\theta}}(s′, a^\*)$. We want to move $Z_{\theta}(s, a)$ towards this target (by keeping the target fixed)."

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huixxi/TensorFlow2.0-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/master/images/distributional_learn.png)

![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Huixxi/TensorFlow2.0-for-Deep-Reinforcement-Learning/master/images/distributional_projected.png)

Then, their KL loss is:  
$$
KL(m||p_{\theta}) = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} m_i \log\frac{m_i}{p_{\theta, i}} = \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} m_i[ \log{m_i} - \log{p_{\theta, i}}] = H(m, p_{\theta}) − H(m)
$$
The gradient of the KL loss is:  
$$
\nabla_{\theta} KL(m||p_{\theta}) = \nabla_{\theta} \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} m_i \log\frac{m_i}{p_{\theta, i}} = \nabla_{\theta}[H(m, p_{\theta}) − H(m)] =  \nabla_{\theta}H(m, p_{\theta})
$$
So, we can just use the *cross-entropy*:  
$$
H(m, p_{\theta}) = - \sum\limits_{i=1}^{N} m_i \log{p_i(s, a; \theta)}
$$
as the loss function.

I feel really sorry to say that actually, this is a failed implementation, just as a reference, but I still hope it to be helpful to someone, and I promise I will try my best to fix it. Further more, I really hope some good guy can check my code, find the wrong place, even as a contributor to make it work together, thanks a lot.



## 8>Noisy DQN  
***Noisy DQN.***  Use stochastic network layers for exploration.  
By now, the exploration method we used are all e-greedy methods, but in some games such as Montezuma’s Revenge, where many actions must be executed to collect the first reward. the limitations of exploring using e-greedy policies are clear. Noisy Nets propose a noisy linear layer that combines a deterministic and noisy stream.  
A normal linear layer with $p$ inputs and $q$ outputs, represented by:  
$$
y = wx + b
$$
A noisy linear layer now is:  
$$
y = (\mu^w + \sigma^w \odot \epsilon^w)x + (\mu^b + \sigma^b \odot \epsilon^b)
$$
Where where $\mu^w + \sigma^w \odot \epsilon^w$ and $\mu^b + \sigma^b \odot \epsilon^b$ replace $w$ and $b$, respectively. The parameters $\mu^w \in R^{q \times p}$, $\mu^b \in R^q$, $\sigma^w \in R^{q\times p}$ and $\sigma^b \in R^q$ are learnable whereas $\epsilon^w \in R^{q\times p}$ and $\epsilon^b \in R^q$ are noise random variables. There are two kinds of Gaussian Noise: 

* **Independent Gaussian Noise:** 
The noise applied to each weight and bias is independent, where each entry $\epsilon^w_{i,j}$ (respectively each entry $\epsilon^b_j$) of the random matrix $\epsilon^w$ (respectively of the random vector $\epsilon^b$ ) is drawn from a unit Gaussian distribution. This means that for each noisy linear layer, there are $pq + q$ noise variables (for p inputs to the layer and q outputs).  

* **Factorised Gaussian Noise:**
By factorising $\epsilon^w_{i,j}$, we can use $p$ unit Gaussian variables $\epsilon_i$ for noise of the inputs and and $q$ unit Gaussian variables $\epsilon_j$ for noise of the outputs (thus $p + q$ unit Gaussian variables in total). Each  $\epsilon^w_{i,j}$ and  $\epsilon^b_j$ can then be written as:
$$
\epsilon^w_{i,j} = f(\epsilon_i)f(\epsilon_j) \\
\epsilon^b_j = f(\epsilon_j)
$$
where $f$ is a real-valued function. In our experiments we used $f(x) = sgn(x) \sqrt{|x|}$. Note that
for the bias $\epsilon^b_j$ we could have set $f(x) = x$, but we decided to keep the same output noise for weights and biases.  

***The total algorithm is as follows:***

Run well, but too slow.(I don't know why...)


## 9>Rainbow  
Finally, we get the integrated agent: Rainbow. It used a **multi-step** distributional loss:  
$$
D_{KL}(\Phi_z d_t^{(n)} || d_t)
$$  
Where $\Phi_z$ is the projection onto $z$, and the target distribution $d_t^{(n)}$ is:  
$$
d_t^{(n)} =(R_t^{(n)} + \gamma_t^{(n)} z, p_\bar{\theta} (S_{t+n}, a^{\*}\_{t+n}))
$$  
Using **double Q-learning** gets the greedy action $a^\*\_{t+n}$ of $S_{t+n}$ through *online network*, and evaluates such action using the *target network*.  

In Rainbow, it uses the KL loss to **prioritize transitions** instead of using the absolute TD error, maybe more robust to noisy stochastic environments because the loss can continue to decrease even when the returns are not deterministic.  
$$
p_t  \propto (D_{KL}(\Phi_z d_t^{(n)} || d_t))^w
$$  

The network architecture is a **dueling network architecture** adapted for use with return **distributions**. The network has a shared representation $f_{\xi}(s)$, which is then fed into a value stream $v_{\eta}$ with $N_{atoms}$ outputs, and into an advantage stream $a_{\xi}$ with $N_{atoms} \times N_{actions}$ outputs, where $a_{\xi}^i(f_{\xi}(s),a)$ will denote the output corresponding to atom $i$ and action $a$. For each atom $z^i$, the value and advantage streams are aggregated, as in dueling DQN, and then passed through a softmax layer to obtain the normalised parametric distributions used to estimate the returns’ distributions:
$$
p_{\theta}^i(s, a) = \frac{exp(v_{\eta}^i + a_{\Phi}^i(\phi, a) - \bar{a}\_{\Phi}^i(s))}{\sum_j exp(v_{\eta}^j + a_{\Phi}^j(\phi, a) - \bar{a}\_{\Phi}^j(s))}
$$  
where $\phi = f_{\xi}(s)$, and $\bar{a}\_{\Phi}^i(s) = \frac{1}{N_{actions}}\sum_{a'}a_{\Phi}^i(\phi, a')$  

Then replace all linear layers with their noisy equivalent(factorised Gaussian noise version).   

Done, and thanks for reading, I hope it could be helpful to someone.   
Any suggestion is more than welcome, thanks again.
